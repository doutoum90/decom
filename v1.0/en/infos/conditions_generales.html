            ways to subscribe. The user can subscribe to a Flow directly through
            the Digiposte Service by filling out a form to subscribe to the
            Document of the Sender concerned. Alternatively, the user can
            subscribe directly to the Sender under the conditions stipulated by
            the Sender. Depending on the nature of the documents and / or the
            contractual relationship between the Sender and the Subscriber,
            subscription may be achieved by signing a Digitisation Agreement.
            The received documents will be stored during the specific retention
            period stated in the contract by each Sender. Original digital
            documents are not counted in the free offer storage space, and can
            thus be stored throughout the statutory retention period set by the
            Sender and Digiposte, without the Subscriber having to subscribe for
            additional storage space.

          To subscribe to and use the Digiposte Service, the user must have full
          legal capacity. Subscribers certify that they are aged 15 or over.
          Subscribers under the age of 15 must certify that they have their
          parents’ consent or the consent of any other person with parental
          authority. Actions taken by minors under 15 years of age are performed

          5.1 Information to enter on the subscription form
        </h4>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          The information the Subscriber enters on the subscription form must be
          correct, sincere and up to date. Subscribers undertake to notify La
          Poste of any changes in their information, either online or through
          Customer Service. To make certain changes, Subscribers must submit a
          request to Customer Service.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Subscribers are solely responsible for failing to update their
          personal information and expressly acknowledge that La Poste cannot be
          held liable for misleading information on their identity.

          5.2 Access to the Digiposte Service
        </h4>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Access to the Digiposte Service is protected by a login and password.
          It is up to the Subscriber to choose a sufficiently strong password to
          prevent unauthorised access to the Digiposte Service and to renew it
          regularly. If the Subscriber chooses a separate password for Digiposte
          that is not used for other Internet or mobile services, this helps
          improve the level of security of the Digiposte vault.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          If the Subscriber has set up access to the Digiposte Service in two
          steps, a unique code will be received by SMS with each authentication.
          This code must be entered on the screen provided for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          To enhance security of access to the Vault, Digiposte requires the
          entry of a six-digit code for each connection from a new device or a
          new browser used by the Subscriber. This code is sent to the e-mail
          address that serves as a login for connecting to Digiposte
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Confirmed devices and browser will be registered and recognised by
          Digiposte.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          For security purposes, Subscribers may be asked to re-authenticate on
          the Digiposte Service by entering their login and password.
        </p>

        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Users may authenticate their access to the Application by means of a
          fingerprint, facial recognition or any other means provided by mobile
          device manufacturers. In this situation, Subscribers are informed that
          the authentication is performed directly on their device and that La
          Poste is not sent any biometric data. As La Poste has no control over
          this feature, Subscribers are solely responsible for choosing to use
          it. La Poste may not be held liable for any malfunction or defect in
          this mode of authentication.

        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">Digiposte is free.</p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          However, some features are only available to Subscribers to one of the
          Paid Offers or through the Application, depending on the monthly or
          annual subscription packages. The Paid Offers may be taken out on the
          Digiposte Website or through the Marketplace (e.g. Apple App Store or
          Google Play Store) and requires prior downloading by the Subscriber.
          Purchasing from a Marketplace is subject to the specific terms and
          conditions of each Marketplace.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Rates are accessible on the Marketplaces and the Digiposte Website:

          >
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Those Paid Offers may also be offered by La Poste partners or
          subscribed to directly through them. The subscription terms and rates
          are indicated on the site of the La Poste partner.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Subscription to one of the Paid Offers is a periodic subscription,
          automatically renewable for an equal period unless terminated by the
          Subscriber at any time during this period. Termination must result in
          the disabling of automatic renewal on the Digiposte Website, or in the
          Marketplace or through the La Poste partner, depending on the
          subscription terms. It is up to the Subscriber to take the necessary
          steps to do so. Under no circumstances may La Poste complete these
          formalities with the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store or the La
          Poste partner on the Subscriber’s behalf.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          In any case, any subscription started will not be refunded.
          Accordingly, the termination of any current subscription will be
          effective only on expiry of that subscription.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          At the end of the subscription period, the features covered by the
          subscription will no longer be accessible and the terms and conditions
          corresponding to the Digiposte Service’s free offer will apply.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          For example, if the storage space exceeds the free offer limit, no
          documents are lost or deleted, but none can be added. The storage
          space will have to be cleared. Nevertheless, Documents filed by
          Issuers will continue to be received in the Digiposte account.

        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          The Digiposte Service may give access to information or services
          provided by partners, especially Issuers. Subscribers may also give
          third-party services access to the Content of their choice, with their

          access, supply and use of this information and partner services, as

          Subscribers confirm that they own the intellectual property rights and

          authorisation) as well as any damage incurred by La Poste and/or its

          Notwithstanding cases of force majeure referred to in this document,
          La Poste commits, within the framework of a best endeavour obligation,
          to guarantee the availability and accessibility of the Website, the
          Application and the Digiposte Service, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
          However, tests, checks and/or maintenance operations as well as
          interventions required in the event of a breakdown, can be carried out
          by La Poste at any time. La Poste strives to inform users of these
          operations when possible. La Poste may not be held liable for any
          consequences to any Subscriber.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Subscribers recognise that La Poste can under no circumstances be held
          liable for the functional and technical performances of the Internet.
          Similarly, all Subscribers are responsible for their actions online,
          regarding the use of their data on open networks.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          The Subscriber undertakes not to hinder the smooth running of the
          Website, the Application and the Digiposte Service, particularly by
          transmitting any components likely to contain a virus or that may
          otherwise damage or affect the Website and/or the Application and/or
          the Digiposte Service and, more generally, the IT system of La Poste

          In particular, in the case of the use of the Application through
          smartphones or tablets, the Subscriber agrees not to modify the

          (including jailbreak or root). In such a case, La Poste cannot
          guarantee the security of Documents sent to or from the Digiposte

          11.1. Responsibility of La Poste
        </h4>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          La Poste shall not be held liable for any unauthorised access by a
          third part to the Subscriber’s account, if this access occurs after
          the third party has obtained the access code or access to the e-mail
          address linked to the Subscriber’s account. In such a case, in the
          event of a request for blocking access by the Subscriber, access to
          the account shall be temporarily suspended by La Poste until the
          latter has issued a new access code.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          La Poste does not guarantee the ability of the Website and/or the
          Application and/or the Digiposte Service to meet the specific
          expectations or needs of Subscribers. Similarly, La Poste cannot
          guarantee the absence of error or any other operating or use problems
          affecting the Website and/or the Application and/or the Digiposte
          Service.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          La Poste may not be held responsible for the Content received or
          transmitted from the Subscriber’s Digiposte Service. Likewise, the
          User remains solely responsible for the assessment of their legal
          value by any authority or jurisdiction. Thus, the technical processing
          carried out by La Poste on a Document is only a guarantee as to the
          origin, date of filing and integrity of the Documents.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          La Poste cannot be held liable for Contents it hosts or the
          information sent by the Subscriber to the public and/or other
          Subscribers. La Poste, in its capacity as a purely technical service
          provider, particularly as host of Subscribers’ Content, may not be
          held liable for the activities or information stored at the request of
          Subscribers if La Poste was unaware of their illegal nature or of
          facts and circumstances revealing this character, or if, as soon as La
          Poste became aware of such facts, it acted swiftly to remove the
          information or block access to it.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          In this respect, La Poste reserves the right to remove or suspend the
          access to any Content following receipt of a notification or if it
          gains knowledge of the clearly illegal character of the Content. La
          Poste may under no circumstances be held liable for removing such
          Content.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Under no circumstances may La Poste be held liable for indirect damage
          such as: financial loss, commercial damage, loss of clientele, any
          commercial disruption, loss of profits, loss of brand image, loss of
          data and/or software affecting the Subscriber which could result from
          the non-performance of these TCU. Moreover, La Poste cannot be held
          liable for damages resulting, even in part, from the total or partial
          non-performance of obligations by the Subscriber, or for any indirect
          damage, even if it knows that such damage may occur.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Regarding Document Collectors, La Poste shall not be held liable for
          any delay in receipt of the documents or document unavailability,
          notably when the delay or impossibility of retrieving the documents
          results from a change made by the third parties that impedes document
          reception.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Concerning the “Visible Electronic Stamp” service, La Poste is not
          responsible for the creation of 2D Codes and their inclusion in
          documents. Its responsibility cannot therefore be sought in the event
          that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The 2D Code could not be read by Digicheck;</li>

          such as modification, suspension, interruption of Digicheck or
          unavailability of networks that are not entirely under its control
          will occur during the use of Digicheck. La Poste is not responsible
          for the sustainability, compliance, compatibility or performance of
          Digicheck.

        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          La Poste is not liable for any delay in the performance or for any

          Cancelling the Digiposte Service will lead to the automatic

          all or part of the Digiposte Service for reasons linked to the
          security of the service, the security of the Subscriber,
          non-compliance or suspected non-compliance by the Subscriber with one
          of the obligations stated in this document. This cancellation will be
          automatic, without prejudice to any damages that La Poste may seek.
          Subscribers may nevertheless for a limited period of time retrieve
          their archived Contents according to the conditions of article 13.3 of
          these TCU.

          In case of account closure, La Poste shall inform Subscribers at least
          three (3) months in advance before suspending or closing the service
          to enable them to retrieve the documents and data stored in their
          digital vault.

          La Poste also reserves the right to unilaterally end this contractual

          repeated breaches by the Subscriber of one of the obligations listed
          in this document, or in the event of La Poste definitively ending
          their Digiposte Service. In the latter case, cancellation will be
          effective six (6) months after informing users of the end of the

          initiate proceedings to delete the Digiposte Account: if so, La Poste
          sends an e-mail to the Subscriber at their e-mail address, informing
          them that, unless they log into their Digiposte Account within one (1)
          month, their Digiposte Account will be deleted. After this one-month
          period has ended, La Poste may automatically cancel the TCU and delete
          the Subscriber’s Digiposte Account and therefore all of the Content it
          contains. However, the subscription may only be cancelled if the
          Digiposte Account does not contain Documents sent by a Sender with a

          When a Digiposte Account is cancelled, the Subscriber loses all the
          additional features, so should check that they have retrieved all of
          the Digiposte Account Content, ended all their subscriptions with
          Senders and Collectors, closed their Sharing Spaces and cancelled all
          Digitisation Agreements to which they have subscribed. La Poste cannot
          be held liable for losses caused by not following these steps.

          Contractual relations will end if the TCU between La Poste and the

        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          The cancellation will be automatic within around 48 hours from the
          cancellation request by the Subscriber.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          In the event that a Subscriber has a Subscription to one of the Paid
          Offers, cancellation will be effective when this Subscription expires.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          Cancelling a Digitisation Agreement with a Sender will not lead to the
          TCU being terminated nor the relationship with the Sender being
          terminated, only the ability to receive or send Content with the
          Sender digitally.

          If the claimant wishes their case to be re-examined when the initial
          claim has been dealt with, they may lodge an appeal, under the same
          conditions as the initial claim, or through a consumers’ association.
        </p>
        <p class="generic-digiposte-main-p-1">
          The case will be heard by the bodies set up by La Poste to hear
          appeals. Cases must be referred to the internal appeal bodies prior to
          being referred to the Mediator of Le Groupe La Poste.

          Finally, the Customer has the possibility, if they are not satisfied
          with the answer from La Poste’s appeal body or they have not received
          a reply two months after submitting his or her complain, of referring
          a matter to the Mediator of the Le Groupe La Poste, an independent
          entity that is competent for any dispute concerning all products and
          services covered by these Terms and Conditions of Use. The mediation
          process is free.

          agent, legal guardian, etc.).

          La Poste invokes the statute of limitations with regard to any
          time-barred files laid before the Mediator. In the absence of
          agreement between the parties, the Mediator shall make a solution
          proposal, within a period of two months of notification of the
          mediation process by its services. This period may be extended in the
          event of particular difficulties requiring additional investigative
          measures. The parties shall be informed of the extension.
